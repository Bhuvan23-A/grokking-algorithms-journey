# Grokking Algorithms – Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning journey while reading  
**Grokking Algorithms** by Aditya Bhargava.

The goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of fundamental
algorithms and data structures by:

- explaining concepts in my own words,
- implementing algorithms from scratch in Python,
- analysing time & space complexity,
- connecting ideas to real-world use cases.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each chapter from the book has its own folder containing:

- `README.md` → Conceptual explanation + notes
- `.py` files → Code implementations (where applicable)

This keeps theory and code cleanly separated.
