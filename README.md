# Grokking Algorithms – Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning journey while reading  
**Grokking Algorithms** by Aditya Bhargava.

The purpose of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of core algorithmic concepts
by writing explanations in my own words and implementing each algorithm
from scratch.

## What this repository contains
- Simple explanation for each algorithm
- Python implementations written by me
- Time and space complexity analysis

## How this repo is organized
Each chapter from the book has its own folder containing:
- `README.md` → Conceptual explanation
- `.py` file → Code implementation


## Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Focus: Algorithms, problem-solving, foundations

## Status
🚧 In progress – updated as I continue learning
